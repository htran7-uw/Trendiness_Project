# Twitter Trendiness Score Schema Design

Our data warehouse will have one main table (base) with 2 tables (words, phrases) generated via subqueries on the base table. The base table is generated by reading in the stream of tweets from the API and assigning the time stamp to one column and the tweet text to another column. 

The base table is in the following form: TIME | ENTIRE_TWEET_TEXT

The phrases table will be in the following form: TIME | PHRASE

The words table will be in the following form: TIME | WORD
The words table will have a unqiue row for every word found within the tweet stream and its associated time stamp.
  
The core of our schema relies on the assumption that we do not care about what actual tweet a word or phrase came from. All we truly care about is the word or phrase and its paired time stamp. Because of this, there is not a unique ID assigned to any tweet nor to any specific word or phrase.
